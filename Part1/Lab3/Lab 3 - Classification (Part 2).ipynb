    "### Problem 1: Spam Detection (70 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will be constructing a crude spam detector. As you all know, when you receive an e-mail, it can be divided into one of two types: ham (useful mail, label $-1$) and spam (junk mail, label $+1$). In the [olden days](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html), people tried writing a bunch of rules to detect spam. However, it was quickly seen that machine learning approaches work fairly well for a little bit of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be designing a spam detector by applying some of the classification techniques you learned in class to a batch of emails used to train and test [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/), a leading anti-spam software package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the *vocabulary* of a dataset be a list of all terms occuring in a data set. So, for example, a vocabulary could be [\"cat\",\"dog\",\"chupacabra\", \"aerospace\", ...]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our features will be based only the frequencies of terms in our vocabulary occuring in the e-mails (such an approach is called a *bag of words* approach, since we ignore the positions of the terms in the emails). The $j$-th feature is the number of times term $j$ in the vocabulary occurs in the email. If you are interested in further details on this model, you can see Chapters 6 and 13 in [Manning's Book](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the following classifiers in this problem:\n",
    "- sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB (Naive Bayes Classifier with Bernoulli Model)\n",
    "- sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes Classifier with Multinomial Model)\n",
    "- sklearn.svm.LinearSVC (Linear Support Vector Machine)\n",
    "- sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression (Logistic Regression)\n",
    "- sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier (1-Nearest Neighbor Classifier)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Bernoulli Model for Naive Bayes, scikit-learn will binarize the features by interpretting the $j$-th feature to be $1$ if the $j$-th term in the vocabulary occurs in the email and $0$ otherwise. This is a categorical Naive Bayes model, with binary features. While we did not discuss the multinomial model in class, it operates directly on the frequencies of terms in the vocabulary, and is discussed in Section 13.2 in [Manning's Book](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/) (though you do not need to read this reference). Both the Bernoulli and Multinomial models are commonly used for Naive Bayes in text classification. "
